GConf is a configuration database system, functionally similar to the
Windows registry but lots better. :-) It's being written for the GNOME
desktop but does not require GNOME; configure should notice if GNOME
is not installed and compile the basic GConf library anyway.

GConf does require glib, ORBit, libxml, and the popt option parsing
library.  XML will be optional in the future if someone writes another
storage backend.

GCONF IS SO INCREDIBLY ALPHA. AS IN, THERE ARE MORE UNTESTED CODE
PATHS THAN TESTED ONES. However, it "theoretically" works and I'm 
interested in people trying it out and looking for bugs.

Incomplete but enough-to-get-started documentation exists in
doc/gconf.sgml.  Run "db2html" or "db2ps" to get it readable (db2html
is in cygnus-stylesheets package on Debian, also comes in Red Hat
powertools and Mark Galassi makes the RH packages available online).
