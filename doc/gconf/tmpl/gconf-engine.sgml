a GConf "database"

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
A #GConfEngine represents a connection to the GConf database. The
default #GConfEngine, returned from gconf_engine_new(), represents the
user's normal configuration source search path. Configuration-related
utilities, such as a configuration editor tool, might wish to access a
particular configuration source directly; they can obtain a
non-default #GConfEngine with gconf_engine_new_from_address().
</para>

<para>
Once you have a #GConfEngine, you can query and manipulate
configuration values.
</para>

<!-- ##### SECTION See_Also ##### -->

<!-- ##### STRUCT GConfEngine ##### -->
<para>
An opaque data type representing one or more configuration sources.
</para>

@dummy: 

<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_engine_new ##### -->
<para>
Returns the default #GConfEngine. All clients should use this, unless 
they are special configuration-related tools. The caller of this
function assumes one reference count, and must call
gconf_engine_unref() at some point. It's fairly important to unref the
#GConfEngine, to cleanly close the connection to
<application>gconfd</application>. So if possible close the connection
before exiting your application.
</para>

@Returns: the default #GConfEngine.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_engine_new_from_address ##### -->
<para>
Creates a special #GConfEngine; mostly useful for specialized
GConf-related tools. Normal clients shouldn't need to use it.
As with gconf_engine_new(), the returned #GConfEngine should be
unreferenced by the caller of this function.
</para>

@address: a configuration source address.
@err:  the return location for an allocated #GConfError, or <symbol>NULL</symbol> to ignore errors.
@Returns: a new #GConfEngine.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_engine_unref ##### -->
<para>
Decreases the reference count of a #GConfEngine by one; if the
reference count reaches 0, destroys the #GConfEngine.
</para>

@conf: a #GConfEngine.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION gconf_engine_ref ##### -->
<para>
Increases the reference count of a #GConfEngine by one.
</para>

@conf: a #GConfEngine.
